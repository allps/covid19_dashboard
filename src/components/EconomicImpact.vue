                            McKinsey proposes different scenarios for Africa's growth in the wake of COVID-19. Before the crisis, the 2020 growth estimate for the continent was 3.9 percent. In the "least-worst case," characterized by the outbreak being somewhat contained both globally and in Africa, growth drops to 0.4 percent. In other scenarios (including a lack of containment globally and in Africa), the rate drops as low as -3.9 percent. The scenarios explicitly do not take into account either fiscal stimulus packages or currency devaluations.

                            Breisinger and others estimate monthly GDP losses for Egypt under a range of scenarios, with estimates around 0.7 to 0.8 percent.

                            In Kenya, day laborers are dramatically affected. "The coronavirus containment measures are expected to bring additional economic hardship in a country where informal labourers account for 83.6 percent of the total workforce."
